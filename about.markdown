## About me ##

Hello there. My name is *Sreejith Kesavan* and I'm a [Python](http://python.org) Developer living in Bangalore, India. I'm a passionate [GNU/Linux](http://linux.org) [hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) and a hardcore [FCBarcelona](http://fcbarcelona.cat) fan. When I'm not busy coding, you'd find me mashing buttons on my [PlayStation 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) playing my [favourite games](/games/).

Apart from writing here, I do follow some popular tech writings on the web. These are some of my favourites.

* *[Armin Ronacher's Thoughts and Writings](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/)*
* *[Georg Brandl's Pythonic](http://pythonic.pocoo.org/)*
* *[Jeff Atwood's Coding Horror](http://codinghorror.com)*
* *[Ian Bicking: A Blog](http://blog.ianbicking.org/)*

And some of my friends are also into blogging

* *[Abhi's Experiments](http://abhidsm.blogspot.com)*
* *[Manu's new Universe](http://manuknkra.wordpress.com/)*

## My setup ##

Recently I switched from a Toshiba Satellite L310 laptop to a [13" Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/in/macbookpro/specs-13inch.html) (MC700, Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM) which I use for all my computing needs. I use [Vim](http://vim.org), [TextMate](http://macromates.com), [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/) and [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) for all the coding and editing purposes and prefer [iTerm](http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) for commandline access. And I coudn't live without my Ubuntu VM's running under [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) and [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html).

## About this site ##

This site is generated by [Voldemort](https://github.com/semk/voldemort), a blog-aware static site generator using [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), written by me. Previously I was using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for this site and found it too Rubyish. That's how I developed Voldemort and it was fun building it. You could find the source code for this website on my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/semk/foobarnbaz.com). And if you are looking for the old Jekyll sources, you may find it [here](https://github.com/semk/blog). I use [Minimal]() theme by [orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist).
