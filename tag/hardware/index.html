<p>No one would have thought that they could ever buy a computer for $25. Thanks to the smart game developer from <a href="http://www.frontier.co.uk/">Frontier Developments</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Braben">David Braben</a> who designed <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, a $25 dollar computer with the size of a USB Stick, infact it is actually a USB Stick Computer. Have a look,</p>
<p><img alt="Raspberry Pi" src="http://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/rasperry_pi_pcb-580x435.jpg" /></p>
<p>This tiny device comes with an HDMI port in one end and a USB port on the other. You can plug it into a HDMI socket and then connect a keyboard via the USB port turns it into a fully functioning machine running a flavour of Linux. And the Hardware Specs are not that bad at all. It boasts a 700MHz ARM11 processor coupled with 128MB of RAM and runs OpenGL ES 2.0 allowing for decent graphics performance with 1080p. Yes 1080p. You can also add an SD card to the SD card slot for your storage needs. Did I already mention that you can also mount a 12MP camera into this?</p>
<p>It looks like the stock OS it ships with is Ubuntu. That means you can browse, run office apps or do whatever you want to do with a computer. Braben argues that the new ICT syllabus in schools have changed a lot and no one is teaching programming and the internals of computer systems. They are now teaching other <em>useful</em> skills like writing documents in a word processor, how to create presentations etc. This could be his effort to bring back the good stuff back to schools by making an affordable computer for students.</p>

<p>Finally my wish came true. Now I'm a proud owner of an Android phone. Its LG Optimus One, better known as LG P500. Good that it comes with Froyo and LG promises an update to Gingerbread. Here you can find the phone <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_optimus_one_p500-3516.php">specs</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="LG Optimus One" src="http://www.gadgetvenue.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/LG-optimus-one-300x300.jpg" /></p>
<p>This one is a good choice for anyone looking for a budget Android phone (10.8K when I bought) whose battery lasts a complete day with internet on. Thanks to <a href="http://binarykarma.org">Shuveb</a> for providing a review of the phone and atlast making me buy it :-P</p>
<p>Eventhough a Pythonista like me hates Java, the Android platform was tempting me to look at Java with some interest. So I bought <em>Android Application Development by O'Reilly</em> and setup a Development Environment on my laptop using Eclipse. This was so easy that I could run the <em>Hello World</em> program without even writing a piece of Java code. Once you create a Project, it auto-generates files needed for the application to show on the foreground and other resource files and build scripts. By default, they'll create an activity source file with an <em>Activity</em> name you've given. This is pretty much the <em>Hello World</em> program we wanted.</p>

<p>Google has done a great job in developing an easy-to-use and feature-abundant SDK for Android. The Android emulator which comes with the SDK is an engineering masterpiece. It helps the developer to run and test their applications locally before running them on the actual devices.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to develop some useful applications for Android while I finish reading the book. So keep an eye on my <a href="http://github.com/semk">Git Repo</a>.</p>

<h1><a href="/2010/10/02/hacking-playstation3-with-teensy">Hacking PlayStation 3 with Teensy 2.0</a></h1>

<p></p>
<p>I've always been a proud and loyal owner of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">Playstation 3</a> and still I consider it as the most powerful game console of this generation. But things were super-cool back on the days when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">Playstation 3</a> supported <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS">OtherOS</a> by which you could boot and use Linux on your console. This was the very feature (other than GameOS which is why someone should buy a PS3 :-)) every PS3 owner was proud of when comparing his console to its counterparts. This feature was removed by Sony after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz">Geohot's</a> attempts to hack <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">Playstation 3</a> using Linux. Although he was partially succeeded in doing so, soon he disappeared from the PlayStation hacking scene and asked other hackers to continue his work. The PS3 users gained nothing from this untill the mighty <a href="http://psjailbreak.com">PSJailbreak</a> was announced.</p>
<p>I must say, Sony guys have made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">Playstation 3</a> almost unhackable as it took more than 4 years for the console hackers to find an exploit to allow homebrews on it. This exploit which was found in firmware 3.41, allows users to backup <em>Legitimate</em> Copies of PlayStation Games to internal/external harddisk. This is achieved by installing an application called Backup Manager. The team to announce this hack was <a href="http://psjailbreak.com">PSJailbreak</a>, who used a USB dongle to boot from which took advantage of the exploit found in 3.41. Later open source implementations of <a href="http://psjailbreak.com">PSJailbreak</a> like <a href="http://github.com/psgroove/psgroove">psgroove</a>, psfreedom etc. came which used popular development boards like <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html">Teensy ++</a> and <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3879">Atmel AT90USBKEY</a>.</p>
<p>I was really excited to see this progress and I liked the idea of backing up games. If you buy Original Games for $50, atleast there should be one way to make backups so that you can play games even if yor media is damaged. So I logged on to <a href="http://pjrc.com">pjrc</a> and ordered one <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy 2.0 USB Development Board</a> which used <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?part_id=4317">Atmel ATMEGA32U4 AVR</a>. It took almost 3 weeks to ship to India from US. I checked out <a href="http://github.com/psgroove/psgroove">psgroove</a> code from GitHub and used the Teensy Loader utility to flash the compiled hex code to the board.</p>
<p>For this jailbreak to work, you need to hard power your PS3 after connecting the usb board. Turn on the console and immediately press eject button for the exploit to work. If everything goes proper, the orange led in Teensy board will light up. Tada! The PlayStation is Jailbroken. Take a look at the snaps I took during Jailbreaking my console.</p>
<p><img alt="Flashed Teensy" src="/images/posts/2010-10-02-hacking-playstation3-with-teensy/teensy_loaded.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="Exploited" src="/images/posts/2010-10-02-hacking-playstation3-with-teensy/exploited.jpg" /></p>

<p><img alt="Backup Manager" src="/images/posts/2010-10-02-hacking-playstation3-with-teensy/backup_manager.jpg" /></p>

<p><img alt="Backing up Uncharted" src="/images/posts/2010-10-02-hacking-playstation3-with-teensy/backing_up.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="FTP Server" src="/images/posts/2010-10-02-hacking-playstation3-with-teensy/ftp_server.jpg" /></p>
<p>The latest firmware update from Sony patches this exploit and even they are banning consoles using Backup Manager when they connect to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network">PSN</a>. As I love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network">PSN</a> and playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves">Uncharted 2</a> online, soon I have to update my firmware to 3.50. Even legitimate users are irritated by this move by Sony. If iPhone Jailbreak is legal, this is also legal. Right ?</p>
<p>Had Sony not removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS">OtherOS</a>, none of this would have happened OR atleast it would have taken more time for the hackers to hack the console. "Sony, never do stupid things like this anymore. Please bring back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OtherOS">OtherOS</a>."</p>
