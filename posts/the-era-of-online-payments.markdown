We live in a century defined and driven by technology. Internet has changed the way approach the needs in our life. Very rarely people are going to an Electronic/Computer store to buy stuffs when there is an option to order it online. Now, all of the consumer centric business have an online version too.

I was using [RechargeItNow](http://rechargeitnow.com) for recharging my cell phone and DTH services. But their website was too cluttered and filled with advertisements all over the place. Then I found [JustRechargeIt](https://justrechargeit.com). Their web application was way too better than the RechargeItNow website. They even provided options to save lists of phone numbers and DTH accounts to ease the payment. I was happily using this service for a long time until I found [Paytm](http://paytm.com). Paytm web application is so simle and intuitive. Just have a look.

The simplicity and way of presentation is an important aspect when it comes to the web business. And Paytm has succeeded in doing so. I really want to see more and more web applications doing the same like what Paytm did for user experience, hopefully [eBay](http://ebay.in) :-)
