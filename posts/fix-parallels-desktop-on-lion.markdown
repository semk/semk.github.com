Most of the [Parallels Desktop 6](www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) users are experiencing an [issue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4yhICBqpfk) not finding the virtual machine windows after upgrading to [Mac OSX Lion](www.apple.com/macosx/). This might be caused by the Desktop (inwhich Parallels to run on) being set to `None` during upgrade. [Mission Control](http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/mission-control.html) to blame? But this can be fixed very easily. Follow these steps,

1. Create a Dock Icon for Parallels Desktop if not
2. Launch Parallels Desktop
3. Right click the Parallels Dock Icon and go to `Options`. Then set `Assign To` to `This Desktop`.
4. Done.

According to Parallels FAQ, there is one more workaround to fix this issue,

1. Delete all the spaces except the default one
2. Reboot and restart Parallels

I hope this will be helpful for those struggling to get around this issue.
