[Voldemort](https://github.com/semk/voldemort) is a blog-aware static site generator inspired by [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/). All these times this blog was generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and I always wanted to use something Pythonic. [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde) was there, but the awesomeness of Jinja2 forced me to write Voldemort on my own.

Voldemort has its own advantages. You can templatize your HTML pages using Jinja and write posts using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). And if you like this website, then you've got one reason to tryout Voldemort. Go for an [install](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/voldemort/0.6.0) or grab the [sources](https://github.com/semk/voldemort) if you want to tweak it your own way.
