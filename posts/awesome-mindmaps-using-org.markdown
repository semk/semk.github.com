Whoever using [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) as their primary text-editor would have liked the [Org mode](http://orgmode.org/). As the Org website puts it:-

> Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org mode allows you to create documents with a simple syntax. Different headers/sections in the document can be represented by a `*` symbol. A single `*` corresponds to an `<h1>` block in HTML and `**` represents a `<h2>`.

Org mode has the capability to export documents to various formats like ASCII text, PDF, LaTeX, XOXO, HTML, Freemind Mindmap etc. I was not quite happy with the output produced by [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) from the `.mm` files exported by Org mode. So I switched to [Mindnode](http://mindnode.com/), another mindmapping software which is available for Mac OSX and produces visually pleasing mindmaps. But the `.mm` exports from Org mode doesn't work pretty well with Mindnode. So I wrote a simple [Org2OPML](https://github.com/semk/Org2OPML) converter that converts `.org` files to `.opml` files. OPML is another formats for mindmps/outlining and well supported by Mindnode.

The `.org` representation of the mindmap

Have a look at the mindmap generated by Mindnode once the `.org` file is converted to OPML using Org2OPML script.
