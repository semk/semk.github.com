I have learned a big lesson from losing all the blog archives from my previous blog [semk.in](http://semk.in), that never ever host a blog without any backups. I didn't pay any attention to domain/hosting expiration date since I was busy working at that time. But finally everything was deleted in a matter of seconds. I never blamed the hosting provider for this. They kept mailing me all the day. Recently I came to know about using [Github](http://github.om) + [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for blogging from [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) which I think is the best way to maintain the website code. Thats why this new site got spawned up. 

This website layout is a fork of [Tate Johnson's site](http://tatey.com) with some minor modifications. Stay tuned for interesting stuffs ...

Thanks,
