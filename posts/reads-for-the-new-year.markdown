Now I have two new good books to read for this New Year. The classic [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs/SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and [To Mock a Mockingbird](http://www.amazon.com/Mock-Mockingbird-Other-Logic-Puzzles/dp/0394534913) ([Raymond Smullyan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan)), a humorous introduction to [combinatory logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic) with the help of [interesting puzzles](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/09/classic-computer-science-puzzles.html).

SICP was used as the textbook of MIT's old introductory programming class [6.001](http://sicp.ai.mit.edu/Spring-2007/). Later this class has been replaced by [6.01](http://mit.edu/6.01/mercurial/spring10/www/index.html), which uses Python. It is also known as the wizard book beacause it features the image of a wizard on its cover page.

To Mock a Mockingbird contains numerous logical puzzles and by solving them, you will eventually learn some theories and concepts in combinatorics and [lambda calulus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), the base of [Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language) programming.

Well. Afterall, its time to say good bye to 2010 and welcome 2011.
